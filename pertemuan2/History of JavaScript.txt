What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a scripting language that is one of the three core languages used to develop websites. 
Whereas HTML and CSS give a website structure and style, JavaScript lets you add functionality and 
behaviors to your website, allowing your website’s visitors to interact with content in many imaginative ways.

Sejarah JS
1960 - The internet was invented
1990s - Netscape’s Navigator and Microsoft’s Internet Explorer going head to head 
1995 - a Netscape programmer named Brandan Eich developed a new scripting language in just 10 days. 
	It was originally named Mocha, but quickly became known as LiveScript but today it is JavaScript.


Difference of Java and JavaScript
Same names, but no similarities.
started out as JavaScript with support form Netscape upon 1 simple Java application in the Netscape browser.

ECMAScript
In 1997, due to JavaScript’s rapid growth, it became clear that the language would need to be properly maintained and managed. 
Therefore, Netscape handed the job of creating a language specification to the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA), 
a body founded with the goal of standardizing computing. The ECMA specifications were labeled ECMA-262 and ECMAScript languages 
included JavaScript, JScript, and ActionScript.

Ajax is born
The year 2005 proved to be a big one for JavaScript. A paper released by Jesse James Garrett introduced Ajax, 
a revolutionary suite of technologies that included JavaScript. Ajax vastly improved user experience by allowing 
web pages to feel more like native desktop apps.

ReactJS
React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, who released an early prototype of React called "FaxJS". 
He was influenced by XHP, an HTML component library for PHP. It was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and later 
on Instagram in 2012. It was open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013. Available on GitHub in Jul 3, 2013.

How React Native Came
Traditionally, native mobile apps have been developed in specific languages that call platform-specific APIs. For example, 
Objective-C and Swift for iOS app development; Java and Kotlin for Android app development. This means that developers who 
wish to release their app on multiple platforms will have to implement it in different languages. To avoid this duplication, 
hybrid apps came along. The app was implemented using web technologies but instead of running it inside a web browser, it was 
wrapped and distributed as an app. But it had performance limitations. 	

React Native
The first public preview was in January of 2015 at React.js Con. In March of 2015, 
Facebook announced at F8 that React Native is open and available on GitHub. 

Benefits and Advantages of React Native
1. React Native speeds up the development and saves money 
2. React Native is free
3. The largest company are using React Native (instagram, Tesla, Skype, Pinterest)
4. React Native is easy to market
5. React Native is as fast as native
6. JavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world
7. React is the most popular cross-platform framework for mobile development
